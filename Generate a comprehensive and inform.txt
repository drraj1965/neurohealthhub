The articles published in article-gen-ai site = article-gen-ai-drphaniraj1965.replit.app - has to be displayed in the home page of our site - https://neuro-health-hub-1-drphaniraj1965.replit.app/; in that page the user can sort and filter by date, month, year, topic - and when clicked, takes user to the article; plus, new articles have to be added to this page when the admin / article creator shares to the site. So, basically, we need modifications to both the sites - add share button to the articles in the article list of the article-gen-ai page; when admin makes any changes / editing of an article, then he can share again to update the link in the home page of neurohealthhub - for this, Changes in Article-Gen-AI Project
