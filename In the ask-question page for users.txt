In the ask-question page for users - the speech-to-text function has to work properly; implement a system of being able to see the text as it is converted in the space below the text box before it appears inside the text box
In the articles page, when I try to log out - instead of being taken to the login page - I am getting this error: 
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

Check the logout function in every page where it appears and make sure it works
In the manage-questions page - (1) The user who has posted the question is not identified - currently it shows as 'Unknown' - we need the first_name and last_name; (2) The Unanswered filter does not fetch any questions - we have to make sure this filter works - check if the questions are being stored with that label - or if there is a change in label after it is answered - identify why this filter is not working and sort out the issue; (3) The logout button did not work - I got the success message but there was no redirect to the login page; 
In the manage-questions page add a link for admin to go back to dashboard - and make it functional;
In the ask-question page, the logout button is not working - there is no redirect to the login page;
In the video view page the admins should be allowed to answer the comments / questions of users - implement this feature
In the manage-questions page, the back-to-dashboard button leads to https://53babb82-3296-431b-bd14-6e41f2899d7c-00-2fks6z4vpnuoe.riker.replit.dev/admin-dashboard - this gives a 401 page - can we have the correct redirect to the admin-dashboard page implemented?
In the manage-questions page - the Unanswered question filter still does not fetch any questions - carefully look at the database and check how questions are being stored - by default they should be labelled as 'Unanswered' and when answered, this label would change to 'Answered' - if this system is not implemented in the database, then make sure it is and then confirm that the filter for answered and unanswered questions is working correctly throughout the website


In the dashboard for both users and Admins, we have to add one more card; this card will be about latest articles and videos posted by the Admins; this will inform the viewers (both users and Admins) of the articles and videos posted in the last 7 days; it will be attractive, colorful, positive and exciting; it will provide a summary of what articles or videos were posted, who posted them and the time / day of posting; this will update every time there is a new post; it will link to the article or video blog page and open the particular article or video the user or admin clicks; this card will be positioned in an appropriate eye-catching position in the page.
